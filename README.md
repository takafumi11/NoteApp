Note App Clone

## What I have done

- display title
- display textfield
- display memos as List(prepare dummy data)
- when click memo, move to updateView(Itâ€™s TextEditor)
- reflect the changes in the memo.(only title)
- when press button, The information in the first memo is changed.

## Blocker

- It was confirmed that it is possible to influence the data by pressing the buttons.
I want to be able to add values to an array by pressing a button.
- The "print" method is difficult to use, making it difficult to debug and know the contents of variables.

## What I want to do

- When press button, create new blank page and move to the page.
- Instead of a separate title and body, the first line of the body should be bold as the title.
- Now I make UI roughly, so I want to close real design.

I will be working two days next week and will finish during Golden Week.
